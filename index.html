  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <div class="callout">
      <p>I’m a New York-based senior data reporter for the Financial Times' specialist publications covering asset and wealth management — the money, the people who move it, and the power that follows. Most days I’m parsing filings, public records and messy datasets, then pressure-testing those findings with on-the-record reporting.</p>
      <p>I was a 2024 SABEW Goldschmidt fellow and a 2025 Neal Award finalist for a three-part investigation into broker terminations. Before FT, I covered higher education and campaign finance in North Carolina. I studied statistics at UNC-Chapel Hill and once wrangled spreadsheets for my college paper, The Daily Tar Heel, as data editor.</p>
      <p>More broadly, I care about how businesses, governments and everyday people collide. I aim to close the gap between decisionmakers and the people their decisions affect through reporting that informs and promotes accountability.</p>

  <!-- HOW I WORK -->
  <section id="how-i-work"><!-- HOW I WORK -->
  <section id="how-i-work">
    <h2>How I Work</h2>

    <p><strong>What does on the record/on background/off the record mean?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>On the record:</em> Anything you say can be quoted and attributed to you by name.</li>
      <li><em>On background:</em> This is used sparingly. I may use the information you provide, but I won’t name you directly. I may describe you as “a person familiar with…” or a similar attribution. How you’re described is something I’d consult you about before publication. </li>
      <li><em>Off the record:</em> Once we agree to something being “off the record” before you share it, I commit not to publish or directly use what you tell me. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Can I review the article before it’s published?</strong></p>
    <p>In general, no. I don’t share drafts of stories before publication. That said, I’m always happy to read back quotes to confirm I’ve captured the wording correctly or fact-check key details if something is especially technical.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I know you don’t have a hidden agenda?</strong></p>
    <p>My job is to report accurately and fairly — not to move markets or push anyone’s talking points. To that end:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I follow the <a href="https://aboutus.ft.com/company/our-standards/editorial-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Times’ editorial code of conduct</a>, which sets clear rules on independence, conflicts of interest, and transparency.</li>
      <li>I don’t invest in individual stocks or funds that I cover, so my reporting isn’t shaped by personal financial gain.</li>
      <li>I don’t accept gifts, paid travel, or perks from sources. If we meet for coffee, I’ll usually insist on picking up the tab.</li>
      <li>If I ever write about a topic where a potential conflict exists, I’ll disclose it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How can I contact you discretely?</strong></p>
    <p>I take source protection seriously. If you’re considering sharing sensitive information, I can be reached via <a href="#contact">Signal or ProtonMail</a> for more secure conversation.</p>

    <p><strong>Something you reported is wrong.</strong></p>
    <p>Accuracy matters. If you think I got something wrong, please email me directly. I’ll review it promptly and, if necessary, correct the record. Corrections and clarifications are published transparently. If you have additional context that didn’t make it into a story, I welcome it — reporting is an ongoing conversation.</p>

    <p><strong>What is a data reporter, anyway?</strong></p>
    <p>It means I use data and documents — from corporate disclosures to government datasets to public records — alongside interviews to tell stories. Sometimes that means analyzing thousands of datapoints in Excel or R; other times it’s as simple as turning a PDF into something searchable. My job is to find the signal in the noise and explain it clearly to inform and promote accountability, and help folks do their jobs better. </p>

    <p><strong>I have a comment/feedback on something you wrote and want to talk to you about it. </strong></p>
    <p>The best way to reach me is via email. I also hold <a href="https://calendly.com/michael-taffe-ft/20min" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open office hours</a> weekly for readers, sources, and anyone curious about my reporting.</p>
