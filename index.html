  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <div class="callout">
      <p>I’m a New York-based data journalist covering the asset and wealth management industries for Financial Times Specialist. I specialize in using data to uncover trends, risks, and power dynamics in global finance. </p>
      <p>I’ve covered the rise of investment firms’ influence over infrastructure, the political blowback to ESG investing, trends in disciplinary actions against financial advisors, the risks and opportunities associated with emerging investment products being marketed to everyday investors.</p>
      <p>I’ve pulled stories out of the information companies and regulators make public themselves, including their spending on private jets and personal security for CEO’s, the flow of lobbying and political campaign spending coming from the industry, and the personal investments of the five SEC commissioners.</p>
      <p>Before FT, I wrote about higher education for a non-profit newsroom for a non-profit newsroom in North Carolina and campaign finance for a team funded by the N.C. Open Government Coalition. I studied statistics at UNC-Chapel Hill and was the data editor for The Daily Tar Heel. </p>
      <p>When I’m not writing or reading the news, I can be found trying to pass as an outdoorsman, or serving as personal staff to my cat, Mabel. (pic of Mabel, pic of outdoorsman, pic of conference)</p>
      <p>I often work on both fast-turnaround news and long-term data projects, combining interviews with quantitative analysis. If you’re reaching out with something time-sensitive, flag it in the subject line. If you have datasets, filings, or public records you think are important, I’d love to see them.</p>

  <!-- HOW I WORK -->
  <section id="how-i-work">
    <h2>How I Work</h2>

    <p><strong>What does on the record/on background/off the record mean?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>On the record:</em> Anything you say can be quoted and attributed to you by name.</li>
      <li><em>On background:</em> This is used sparingly. I may use the information you provide, but I won’t name you directly. I may describe you as “a person familiar with…” or a similar attribution. How you’re described is something I’d consult you about before publication. </li>
      <li><em>Off the record:</em> Once we agree to something being “off the record” before you share it, I commit not to publish or directly use what you tell me. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Can I review the article before it’s published?</strong></p>
    <p>In general, no. I don’t share drafts of stories before publication. That said, I’m always happy to read back quotes to confirm I’ve captured the wording correctly or fact-check key details if something is especially technical.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I know you don’t have a hidden agenda?</strong></p>
    <p>My job is to report accurately and fairly — not to move markets or push anyone’s talking points. To that end:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I follow the Financial Times’ code of conduct, which sets clear rules on independence, conflicts of interest, and transparency.</li>
      <li>I don’t invest in individual stocks or funds that I cover, so my reporting isn’t shaped by personal financial gain.</li>
      <li>I don’t accept gifts, paid travel, or perks from sources. If we meet for coffee, I’ll usually insist on picking up the tab.</li>
      <li>If I ever write about a topic where a potential conflict exists, I’ll disclose it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How can I contact you discretely?</strong></p>
    <p>I take source protection seriously. If you’re considering sharing sensitive information, I can be reached via Signal or ProtonMail for more secure conversation.</p>

    <p><strong>Something you reported is wrong.</strong></p>
    <p>Accuracy matters. If you think I got something wrong, please email me directly. I’ll review it promptly and, if necessary, correct the record. Corrections and clarifications are published transparently. If you have additional context that didn’t make it into a story, I welcome it — reporting is an ongoing conversation.</p>

    <p><strong>What is a data reporter, anyway?</strong></p>
    <p>It means I use data and documents — from corporate disclosures to government datasets to XX — alongside interviews to tell stories. Sometimes that means analyzing thousands of datapoints in Excel or R; other times it’s as simple as turning a PDF into something searchable. My job is to find the signal in the noise and explain it clearly to inform and promote accountability, and help folks do their jobs better. </p>

    <p><strong>I have a comment/feedback on something you wrote and want to talk to you about it. </strong></p>
    <p>The best way to reach me is via email. I also hold open office hours weekly for readers, sources, and anyone curious about my reporting. [Office Hours link here]</p>
